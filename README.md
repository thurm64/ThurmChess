# ThurmChess
Source to thurmchess. Will be periodically updated when I remember to.
All gamemodes (other than online, obviously) can be played offline as they don't require network components.

### Live site can be found [here](http://thurm.us/chess).
## Files
**Game Mechanics**

chess.js - the main file for game logic

chessOnline.js- the component for online and engine games

puzzlesCore.js- the component for puzzles

openingBook.js and puzzles.js- large components to store raw data on the client side.

**Game Storage**

api.php- for updating online games

**Frontend**

All of the other Html and PHP files, their names are self explanatory enough.
Stylesheet is in css/styles.css

**Stockfish.js**

Stockfish.js is not my work, go check out the people who are way smarter than me that made it [here](https://github.com/nmrugg/stockfish.js).
